## Standards Reference

This software implements quality checks based on **publicly available descriptions** of requirements engineering best practices, including:

- **INCOSE® Guide to Writing Requirements (GtWR) v4** — The 42 rules and 15 characteristics referenced in this software are based on publicly available summaries and educational materials. This software does not reproduce the copyrighted text of the GtWR publication. Users seeking the complete and authoritative guide should purchase it directly from INCOSE at [www.incose.org](https://www.incose.org).

- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** — Systems and software engineering — Life cycle processes — Requirements engineering. This software implements quality checks inspired by this standard but does not reproduce its content.

- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2023** — Systems and software engineering — System life cycle processes. Referenced for systems engineering process context.

## AI Improvement Feature

The "AI Improvement" feature in this software uses **rule-based pattern matching algorithms** — it does NOT use ChatGPT, Claude, GPT-4, or any large language model (LLM). No data is transmitted to any external server or API. All processing occurs locally in your web browser.

The term "AI" is used colloquially to describe the automated, intelligent pattern-matching capability of the improvement engine. Users should review all suggested improvements before accepting them, as automated suggestions may not always be appropriate for specific domain contexts.

---

## Data & Privacy

This software:
- Runs **entirely in your web browser** — no server-side processing
- **Does not collect, transmit, or store any user data** on external servers
- **Does not use cookies** for tracking or analytics
- **Does not require an internet connection** after initial download
- Stores temporary data in browser localStorage (cleared when browser data is cleared)
- Saves permanent data only when the user explicitly exports to a file on their local machine

For the complete privacy statement, see [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).
